GitHub is a web-based platform founded in 2008 that facilitates version control and collaboration for software development. It utilizes Git, a distributed version control system, enabling developers to manage and track changes to their code. GitHub offers both public and private repositories, issue tracking, and a marketplace for developer tools. Acquired by Microsoft in 2018, GitHub has become a vital resource for millions of developers worldwide, hosting open-source projects and supporting a diverse range of programming languages.
