Easol, founded in 2017, is the all-in-one platform for managing your entire
experience business, on your terms. Sell directly on your own website with smart
booking, payment, and marketing tools that all work together, brilliantly.

Creating experiences is the best job in the world! But it hasn't always been
that way - because experience creators have been suffering with the wrong tools.
With Easol, there is no more stitching together ineffective tools built for
selling "things", paying third-party booking fees or having to create pricey
custom solutions.

We believe that with the right tools, anyone can turn their passion into an
empire. So we made them â€“ and brought them together to work in sync, all in one
place. We call this '**[Experience Commerce](https://easol.com/ex-commerce)'.**
It's e-commerce specially designed for selling experiences and especially
designed for experience creators.
